üéÅ Stability and `hover`

After some feedback it was clear that the incremental text handling is _hard_ to get right across editors.

This version uses full document sync (much like most LSPs I've checked).

There's also a timeout configured for a few async operations that could hang the UX before.

feat: initial hover functionality (#46)
fix: remove email from author label (#45)
fix: bug with : and invalid searches (#42)
